# 0004 — Mutation testing as a blocking PR gate

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-08-20

## Context

Line coverage answers "was this line executed?", not "would a test notice if the code broke?". That
gap matters most for **AI-assisted tests**, which reliably chase coverage while writing weak assertions
(assert-not-null instead of assert-a-value). A blueprint that invites agents to generate tests needs a
gate that grades *assertion strength*, not just execution. Mutation testing is inherently slower than
unit tests, though, so the gate must stay a guardrail, not a tollbooth — it must not become the thing
that stalls merges.

## Decision

We run **PIT (pitest)** as a **blocking gate** with `mutationThreshold = 80`, configured in
`service/app/build.gradle.kts` and run via `./gradlew :service:app:pitest`.

- **On PRs it runs diff-scoped.** `.github/workflows/pre-merge.yml` computes the backend `*.kt` files
  the PR changed (from `pull_request.base.sha`), maps them to `io.miragon.blueprint.<pkg>.<File>*`, and
  passes them to pitest via `-PmutationTargetClasses`. It blocks the PR on the changed classes' score
  but stays off the critical path, and is skipped when a PR touches no backend code.
- **Nightly runs the full sweep.** `.github/workflows/nightly.yml` mutates the whole
  `io.miragon.blueprint.*` module with no property override — the authoritative gate-80 run — and
  uploads the HTML report as an artifact.
- Both runs **exclude noise**: the generated `adapter.process` package, the Spring bootstrap and
  `BikeCatalogueSeeder`, and the `adapter.inbound.zeebe.*` job workers (thin glue exercised
  only by the slow process tests).
- The **kill-set** is the fast mockk / `@WebMvcTest` / `@DataJpaTest` unit tests; the
  `camunda-process-test` integration tests (`process.*`) and the ArchUnit/Konsist tests
  (`architecture.*`) are excluded from the kill-set — they'd make every run slow and non-deterministic
  without adding mutation signal.

**Why 80 and not 100:** PIT mutates JVM bytecode, and Kotlin emits synthetic constructs (`value class`
null checks, safe-call mapping, `data class` accessors) that are *equivalent mutants* — no test can
kill them. ~23 residual survivors here are all of that kind, so 100% is unreachable without the
commercial arcmutate plugin. 80 is the honest bar.

**What a weak test looks like** (the two patterns the gate caught in this repo's own spike): a test
that asserts too few of a DTO's fields — PIT blanks the unasserted ones (`return ""`) and every test
stays green; and a test that exercises only one branch of a boolean — the *"always return true"*
mutant is then *equivalent* to the original. Both are fixed by asserting **every** mapped field and
**both** outcomes of each branch — one assertion per outcome, not per method.

## Consequences

- **Positive:** AI-generated tests are graded on whether they'd catch a real fault; weak assertions
  surface as surviving mutants with per-mutant, inline feedback — at PR time, on the code the PR
  changed.
- **Negative / trade-offs:** mutation testing is slower than unit tests, hence the diff-scoped PR run
  and the separate nightly full sweep. Gate-80 over a single changed class is stricter granularity than
  over the module, so a PR touching only an equivalent-mutant-heavy Kotlin `value class` can dip below
  80 (fix: assert every field and both branches, or exclude the class), and a second, differently-named
  top-level class in the same file is out of PR scope until the nightly sweep. The threshold is capped
  below 100 by unavoidable Kotlin noise.
- **Neutral:** raising the bar toward 100 is a documented upgrade path — the commercial
  [arcmutate Kotlin plugin](https://docs.arcmutate.com/docs/kotlin.html) filters most of the
  equivalent-mutant noise (`+KOTLIN_NO_NULLS` and Kotlin-aware mutators) and would let the threshold rise.

## Implementation notes

- `service/app/build.gradle.kts` reads the optional `mutationTargetClasses` property (no property →
  full-module scope, used by the nightly sweep and local runs) and sets `failWhenNoMutations = false`
  so a PR whose changed classes are all excluded/non-mutable doesn't fail the build.
- Do **not** rename the `Mutation testing (PIT, gate 80)` job in `pre-merge.yml` — it is the
  branch-protection required check.
