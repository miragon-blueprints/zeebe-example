 * Lifecycle of a leasing application, mirrored from the process:

 * bike is handed to the customer (waiting-period token), {@link #ACTIVE} when the leasing is live after the
 * withdrawal period elapses. {@link #WITHDRAWN} is the in-progress cancellation state: the customer has
 * withdrawn and the compensation runs asynchronously (it may park on a return-clarification task)
 * before it reaches the terminal {@link #CANCELLED}. {@link #REJECTED} and {@link #CANCELLED} are the terminal
 * negative outcomes.
